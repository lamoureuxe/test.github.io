  <p>I am a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at the <a href="https://ubc.ca">University of British Columbia</a>, Vancouver. My research involves using deep learning and computer vision techniques to assess single biological cells. This work is mutli-disciplinary as I use mechatronics (mechanical, electrical, and computer) engineering techniques to answer biomedical research questions.</p>
