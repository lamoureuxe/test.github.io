  <p>I am a PhD student in <a href="https://mech.ubc.ca/">Mechanical Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://ubc.ca">University of British Columbia</a>, Vancouver. My research involves using deep learning and computer vision techniques to assess single biological cells. This work is mutli-disciplinary as I use <a href="https://mech.ubc.ca/research-main/mechatronics-instrumentation/">mechatronics</a> (mechanical, electrical, and computer) engineering techniques to answer <a href="https://mech.ubc.ca/research-main/biomechanics-biomedical-engineering/">biomedical</a> research questions.</p>
